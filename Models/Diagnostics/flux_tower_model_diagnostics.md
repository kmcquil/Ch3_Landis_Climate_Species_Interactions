### Updated LANDIS-II NECN flux tower model diagnostics ###

We set up the updated model to run using a single cell representing the Coweeta flux tower. To check model behavior, I ran the model for 50 years using average climate. 

- Growth of the SOM pools as a fraction over 50 years 
    - SOMTC: 0.38 (Figure 1)
    - SOM1 Surface: 0.84 (Figure 2)
    - SOM1 Soil: 0.22 (Figure 2)
    - SOM2: 0.51 (Figure 2)
    - SOM3: 0.02 (Figure 2)

- The average mineral N is 3.8 g N m-2 (Figure 3). 
- The average nitrogen deposition is 1.53 g N m-2 yr-1
    - (Boggs, McNulty, Gavazzi, & Myers, 2005) found N deposition ranged from 0.8 - 1.6 g N m-2 yr-1 
- The average nitrogen volatilization is 0.06 g N m-2 yr-1 
    - This is within the recommended range specified in the NECN user manual, which is  0 - 0.3 for uplands.

- The average LAI is 7.6 (Figure 4). 
    - (Bolstad, Vose, & McNulty, 2001) found LAI between 2.7 and 8.2 with a median of 5.8 m2.

- The average NEE is -197 g C m-2 yr-1 (Figure 5)
    - (Oishi et al., 2018) found using the flux tower at Coweeta from 2011 - 2015 that the average NEE is -244 gC m-2 yr-1

- The average modeled NPP is 1109 g C/ m2/ yr (Figure 6)
    - (Bolstad et al., 2001) found ANPP between 5.2 - 11.8 with an average of 9.2 based on 16 sites at Coweeta

- The average ET is 702 mm yr-1 (Figure 7)
    - (Oishi et al., 2018) found using the flux tower at Coweeta from 2011 - 2015 that average ET is 856 mm yr-1.

- The average AGB is 26,009 g biomass (Figure 9) 
    - Initial AGB from plot data surrounding the flux tower.
