### Updated LANDIS-II NECN watershed model diagnostics ###

We set up the updated model to run at Coweeta watersheds 14 and 18. To check model behavior, we ran the model for 50 years using average climate. 

- Growth of the SOM pools as a fraction over 50 years 
    - SOMTC: 0.41 
    - SOM1 Surface: 0.97
    - SOM1 Soil: 0.14 
    - SOM2: 0.51
    - SOM3: 0.02

- The average mineral N is 4.0 g N m-2. 
- The average nitrogen deposition is 0.9 g N m-2 yr-1
    - (Boggs, McNulty, Gavazzi, & Myers, 2005) found N deposition ranged from 0.8 - 1.6 g N m-2 yr-1  
- The average nitrogen volatilization is 0.13 g N m-2 yr-1 
    - This is within the recommended range specified in the NECN user manual, which is  0 - 0.3 for uplands.

- The average LAI is 6.2. 
    - (Bolstad, Vose, & McNulty, 2001) found LAI between 2.7 and 8.2 with a median of 5.8 m2.

- The average NEE is -147 g C m-2 yr-1.
    - (Oishi et al., 2018) found using the flux tower at Coweeta from 2011 - 2015 that the average NEE is -244 gC m-2 yr-1

- The average modeled NPP is 1030 g C/ m2/ yr.
    - (Bolstad et al., 2001) found ANPP between 5.2 - 11.8 with an average of 9.2 based on 16 sites at Coweeta

- The average ET is 887 mm yr-1.
    - (Oishi et al., 2018) found using the flux tower at Coweeta from 2011 - 2015 that average ET is 856 mm yr-1.

- The average AGB is 22,659 g biomass.
